# things i have learned
  What i have learned is that Raspberry pi is not a full computer and I learned baout how to code on a different website then Khan academy 
  and how to code on Atom and more and github. I have learned more and web servers and the hardware involved in makigna computer. I Would 
  have wanted a outloine in what you were look for in the style like how many links and photos in it, It would have been a lot easier. I 
  enjoyed on how tp make a live server on atom and github, I can use that in the future.
  
# things i still want to learn
